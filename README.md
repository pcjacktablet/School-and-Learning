School projects and misc learning

This is a java file created in IntelliJ. It uses a deprecated applet class, for learning purposes. Even though the primary goal of creating a functioning start and stop button were met. I can not get the audio file (step.wav in line 156) to play as a secondard function, every time I push the stop button. Any help is appreciated.
